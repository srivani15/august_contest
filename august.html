        <p>The <strong>Beagle</strong> is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger
            foxhound. The <strong>Beagle</strong> was developed primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling.
            Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, the <strong>Beagle</strong> is the
            primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine
            around the world. The <strong>Beagle</strong> is intelligent and is a popular pet due to its size, good
            temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.
